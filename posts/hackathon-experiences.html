                    I'm an avid hackathon attendee and I've gone to my fair share of hackathons. In high school, I had a 
                    vague idea of what hackathons were but it really wasn't until entering the University of Illinois
                    that I really learned what hackathons were about and just how inspiring they can be. My experiences
                    began at HackIllinois 2014, my very first hackathon. Since then, I've gone to many more. This post is
                    a continuous log of my hackathon experiences at those that have past and of those to come.

                    <p class="text">
                    HackIllinois was my very first hackathon experience. I was very fortunately to have entered UIUC during that year (2014) because 
                    it was the first time in a long time that UIUC was hosting a hackathon. As such, it was pretty grand occasion in my opinion.
                    Teams dedicated long hours into making the event as successful as it was.

                            The picture to the left shows some of the many sponsors that make the event possible. Sponsors usually consist of 
                            companies that not only provide funding, prizes, and free apparallel, but mentorship in programming languages and
                            technologies too. Meeting real software engineers and talking to them casually is a great experience because there's
                            so much opportunity to learn. I didn't build anything at my first hackathon, but I did meet a lot of different people
                            and learned so much from them. From then on, I knew this was the first event of many I would attend.

                    <p class="text">
                    With MHacks IV at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I did something I had never done before. I got into one of the chartered
                    buses sent to our school to pick us up, without knowing any of the other students who also went that day. Needless to say I made
                    a lot of friends during the six hour bus ride and throughout the entire weekend event. I was originally planning on attending with a friend
                    but that friend had cancelled last minute. I decided to go anyway and I was determined to have a good time. I ended doing something
                    completely unfamiliar to myself by forming a team with three other strangers (one from my school, another from Michigan, and a highschool student
                    from Pennslyvania). Despite the fact we didn't know each well at the beginning, we were bounded by a common goal which was to build our project
                    and present it. You can get to know a lot about people if you spend 50-plus hours straight working with them and that's an experience pretty unique
                    to a hackathon. We built a hybrid web app that was a proof of concept for a digital parking meter. People could pay for a spot and add time to their
                    meter using just an app on their mobile phone.
