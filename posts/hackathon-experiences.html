                    I'm an avid hackathon attendee and I've gone to my fair share of hackathons. In high school, I had a 
                    vague idea of what hackathons were but it really wasn't until entering the University of Illinois
                    that I really learned what hackathons were about and just how inspiring they can be. My experiences
                    began at HackIllinois 2014, my very first hackathon. Since then, I've gone to many more. This post is
                    a continuous log of my hackathon experiences at those that have past and of those to come.

                    <p class="text">
                    HackIllinois was my very first hackathon experience. I was very fortunately to have entered UIUC during that year (2014) because 
                    it was the first time in a long time that UIUC was hosting a hackathon. As such, it was pretty grand occasion in my opinion.
                    Teams dedicated long hours into making the event as successful as it was.

                            The picture to the left shows some of the many sponsors that make the event possible. Sponsors usually consist of 
                            companies that not only provide funding, prizes, and free apparallel, but mentorship in programming languages and
                            technologies too. Meeting real software engineers and talking to them casually is a great experience because there's
                            so much opportunity to learn. I didn't build anything at my first hackathon, but I did meet a lot of different people
                            and learned so much from them. From then on, I knew this was the first event of many I would attend.

                    <p class="text">
                    With MHacks IV at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I did something I had never done before. I got into one of the chartered
                    buses sent to our school to pick us up, without knowing any of the other students who also went that day. Needless to say I made
                    a lot of friends during the six hour bus ride and throughout the entire weekend event. I was originally planning on attending with a friend
                    but that friend had cancelled last minute. I decided to go anyway and I was determined to have a good time. I ended doing something
                    completely unfamiliar to myself by forming a team with three other strangers (one from my school, another from Michigan, and a highschool student
                    from Pennslyvania). Despite the fact we didn't know each well at the beginning, we were bounded by a common goal which was to build our project
                    and present it. You can get to know a lot about people if you spend 50-plus hours straight working with them and that's an experience pretty unique
                    to a hackathon. We built a hybrid web app that was a proof of concept for a digital parking meter. People could pay for a spot and add time to their
                    meter using just an app on their mobile phone.

                            <p class="text">
                            As mentioned before, one of the great things about hackathons are the sponsors who come and mentor or give tech talks. I talked to an engineer
                            from Google and had an interesting conversation about the future search. I also talked to engineers from companies such as Firebase and shared
                            my project ideas with them. I was always met with enthusiasm which is very encouraging and really made me determined to bring my ideas to light.

                            <p class="text">
                            Aside from the great tech talks, MHacks also had pretty good food. Unfortunately, I usually ended up missing a lot of it because I waited too long
                            to get any!

                    <p class="text">
                    A 24-hour hackathon was hosted at UIUC in the campus's newly opened ECE building on the graduate quad. Unlike the previous hackathon's, this was a 
                    UIUC-only hackathon and was not majorly-advertised as much as the other ones. Capital One sponsored the whole hackathon and there were roughly 30-40
                    other students (The previous ones had 500+ each). My team built Flick, an android app that allowed users to flick their phone and send the most recent
                    web page visited on the default internet browser to a desktop through the use of a chrome extension. Although the hackathon wasn't as grandoise as the others,
                    I still learned a lot about mobile development by working with my team.

                            Boilermake was a 36 hour hackathon at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. There were roughly 500 hackers and over a dozen sponsors. The trip from
                            UIUC to Purdue was about a hour and a half with the chartered bus we were sent. Good food, music throughout the event, quiet sleep rooms, showers, and 
                            friendly hosts made this a very enjoyable event.

                    At this hackathon I picked up a few web development technologies/toolsets including elasticsearch, Node.js, and a few APIs. It was around this point that I realized
                    I do enjoy working with backends mainly because its challenging, interesting, and is a vital part to any software architecture. My teammate and I ended up working on
                    two different projects. One was a search engine for APIs and another a SMS-centered web service. Overall, this was probably one of my favorite hackathon events I attended.
                    I find that at every event, it's easier and easier for me to figure out technical issues (like figuring out an API or web service). I also find that I'm learning how to
                    better manage the teams I'm in. Everyone comes in with different skill levels and attitudes and you really have to adapt to their needs in order to make your team successful
                    and productive.

                    There's nothing like starting Fall Break than with a "healthy" dose of hackathon hacking. Healthy is in quotations marks because attending hackathons can really take a
                    toll on you if you don't take care of yourself. Sleep like a normal person and resist the urge to eat all the snacks and food they give you even if it's all free.  
                    Unfortunately, I don't take my own advice when it comes to staying healthy. Adrenaline always seems to keep me up. Anyway, stay away from the redbull!

                    WildHacks was the weekend beginning UIUC's week long fall break. WildHacks
                    was a 24 hour hackathon taking place at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. There were roughly 300 or so hackers there. My real home is about 25 minutes 
                    away from the event so it was quite convenient for me. I teamed up with one of my friends I had met at MHacks and with three two others I had just met. We built a 
                    web service for correcting grammar and speech. I had a good time talking to company sponsors and mentees from IBM, Microsoft, Venmo, and SpaceX. I really enjoy talking 
                    to them because it's such a great opportunity to learn about what it's like working at the respective companies. Not only that, you can make some pretty good connections.
                    I remember talking to a software developer at SpaceX about what he did there. It was fairly easy to just walk up to him and start a conversation especially since  I have
                    a fair knowledge and interest in rocketry and whatnot. It's easy to strike up a conversation with anyone as long as you show you're curious and willing to ask questions 
                    and listen.
