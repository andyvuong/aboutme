                    Some of my best ideas come right after I run into problems in my everyday life. I've never had any luck with coming
                    up with ideas whenever I was actively trying to think of one. If a teacher gave me 30 minutes to come up with an idea
                    for a project for some topic we were learning in class, then chances are I wouldn't have a very good one. I remember
                    one incident in high school where my world studies teacher split the class into groups. Each group was given the same
                    amount of materials (straws, rubberbands, tape, etc), and tasked with creating something with it in a roughly a hour. The intended 
                    lesson behind this exercise escapes me but my group spent the majority of the time trying to come up with a idea to make.

                            <div class="img-container custom-center"><img id="idea" src="../assets/idea.jpg" alt="idea"/></div>

                            Under pressure from the time limit, it wasn't until the last 10 minutes that we came up with something and built it. Most
                            of the other groups had or were finishing up. Maybe it was the fact that we were running out of time which sparked our
                            creative juices to kick-in. I know it definitely wasn't because we had sat there for almost a hour throwing random ideas around
                            with really no purpose to them other than to use the materials we were given.

                    The idea we came up was actually pretty useful. It was basically a phone case 
                    (made from straws, rubberbands, toothpicks, tape, etc). It ended up being the favorite of the class because
                    it was practical and was built to solve some problem (phone dropping). Others had built makeshift bows or tiny baskets with
                    parachutes(they dropped it from the third floor staircase).

                    The story above always reminds me that you're best ideas don't come from just sitting around trying to think one up. I keep my mind
                    active and the ideas seem to come quickly. At my internship, I do a lot of experimenting with open source software to see whether or
                    not some of their features would be viable for my company's product. This forces me to
                    work with that technology and develop proofs of concepts for possible solutions to business requirements. Each solution is an idea 
                    that doesn't come without some playing around and experimentation.  I find that reading a diverse selection of material (not just 
                    tech-related) is also a great a way to suddenly have an idea. I try to keep up with world news and social issues which gives me
                    ideas for social, health, and other human-centered hack ideas (for mini-projects, hackathons). Anyway, if you take anything at all
                    from this short write-up, it should be that great ideas really just come from actively participating in your everyday life experiences.
